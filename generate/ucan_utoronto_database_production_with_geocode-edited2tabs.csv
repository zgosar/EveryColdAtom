Becker Group	http://jilawww.colorado.edu/beckergroup/	JILA, Boulder	United States of America		40.0074363	-105.2686481	Theory	My research interests are related to the theoretical analysis and numerical simulation of ultrafast processes in atoms, molecules and clusters interacting with intense laser pulses. Laser systems currently generate light pulses with field strengths exceeding that of the Coulomb field within an atom or molecule. Pulse durations are as short as a few femtoseconds (10-15 sec) or even less in the attosecond regime, which correspond to the time scales of electron and nuclear dynamics in materials. My group pursues theoretical studies on the coherent control of chemical reactions, the observation of correlated electron dynamics in atoms and molecules, the imaging of molecular dynamics, and the propagation of ultrashort intense laser pulses. We often work in close collaboration with experimental groups.		theory

In this novel energy regime, tiny energy splittings (due, for instance, to magnetic interactions or molecular rotations) dominate the collision dynamics. My goal is to unravel these delicate energy exchanges and assess their response to external electromagnetic fields. More broadly, I'm looking for novel approaches to understanding collective motions of many-body quantum-mechanical systems such as electrons in an atom or semiconductor device or atoms in a Bose-Einstein condensate.		theory

Such systems are of fundamental importance for ultracold quantum gases, e.g., Bose-Einstein condensates and Degenerate Fermi gases. Collisions involving few atoms can determine the stability/lifetime of ultracold gases and allow for the control of the interactions in the system and the access of novel phases of the matter. Due to its extremely nonpertubative nature, few-body systems pose some of the greatest challenges facing theorists in various fields including atomic, molecular, particle and nuclear physics and chemistry.

We are applying and further developing recent substantial innovations in non-equilibrium quantum field theory for ultracold atomic gases. The functional field theory methods involve non-perturbative approximation schemes which recently have shown, by comparison with exact results, to excellently describe the far-from-equilibrium long-time dynamics of systems, even for strong interparticle forces. With this step a whole new class of phenomena can be accessed.	PD Dr. Thomas Gasenzer	theory

Gorceix Group	http://www-lpl.univ-paris13.fr:8082/	Université Paris Nord / CNRS	France		48.956155	2.341454	Exp	Our experiment creates dipolar Bose Einstein Condensates (BECs) of Cr atoms. In the last decade, the study of such ultracold atom gases has become an interdisciplinary and fascinating field. The realization of degenerate quantum gases opens the way to perform fundamental studies in quantum physics with an almost ideal dilute system displaying tunable properties (density, temperature, interaction strength, ...). This model system can be studied in a highly versatile environment since confining potentials can be tailored at will. Furthermore, since the analysis protocols benefit from the reliability of the laser spectroscopy techniques, the comparison between experimental outcomes and theoretical predictions is much sounder than what is usually met in condensed matter.                To date the available atomic quantum gases are made of atoms interacting through isotropic short-range potentials. The long-range anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction between atoms carrying a large magnetic moment is expected to induce a wealth of new properties. For example, a supersolid phase arises when a dipolar quantum gas is transfered  in a 2D lattice.        The magnetic dipole moment of chromium in the ground state is 6µB. Due to this exceptionally large dipole moment, chromium degenerate gases represent ideal systems to investigate quantum dynamics under the influence of dipolar interactions.        As a first stage to reach degeneracy, we set up a magneto-optical trap for the most abundant bosonic isotope 52Cr and for the fermionic isotope 53Cr. The two isotopes can be trapped separately as well as simultaneously producing a cold dipolar boson-fermion mixture. We studied the collisional properties of these cold gases. In a second stage, several millions 52Cr atoms are optically trapped at the focus of a powerful infrared laser at a temperature on the order of 100µK. Finally, we evaporatively cool the trapped 52Cr atoms down to degeneracy.        We have studied the collective excitations of the chromium BEC and demonstrated the impact of the anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions on the frequencies of the low-energy collective vibration modes of the trapped BEC. In a further set of experiments, we have studied S=3-spin dynamics using our Cr-BECs either in 3D or in restricted 2D and 1D geometries. At very low magnetic fields, spontaneous demagnetization occurs which enables the study of the S=3-spinor physics.        We plan to reach degeneracy for the fermionic isotope 53Cr , and to create strongly correlated systems, by extending our current experiments on the loading of our condensates into optical lattices. This will meet the current burst of interest in the statistical physics of such systems related to the field of quantum magnetism and will open new avenues for the processing of quantum information.

I pursue continuous-wave approaches for application in both gravity-wave antennas and measurement of magnetically induced birefringence of the vacuum. Optical atomic clocks based on a strontium "atomic fountain" will allow "ultra-resolution" determination of linewidths < 10 Hz.

In particular, the recent development of high-energy ultrashort-pulse laser technology (in large part by the research group I co-lead with Professor Murnane) allows generation of coherent extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and soft-X-ray bursts of femtosecond (10-15 sec) and even attosecond duration. (For comparison, the ratio of 1 femtosecond to 1 second is about the same as the ratio of 1 second to 30 million years.) The time scales probed by these light pulses correspond to those of chemical reactions and dynamic processes in semiconductors. Thus short-pulse short-wavelength light provides researchers with a unique tool to observe specific atoms, leading to a deeper understanding of the microscopic mechanisms. In recent years, our group has developed a variety of new techniques to efficiently upconvert ultrashort laser pulses coherently into the EUV and soft-X-ray regions of the spectrum.

Lewandowski Group	http://jilawww.colorado.edu/lewandowskilab/	JILA, Boulder	United States of America		40.0074363	-105.2686481	Exp	My group uses a two-step process to prepare ultracold molecules of NH, a simple free radical. The first step, supersonic expansion, forces NH molecules through a small opening into a vacuum system, where intermolecular collisions cool the rapidly expanding gas (400 m/s) to less than 1 K. The second step uses varying electric fields (Stark deceleration) to slow the cold molecules to rest. Once the molecules are cold and stopped, we can subject them to magnetic trapping, electrostatic trapping, laser cooling, or sympathetic cooling. I plan to work with theorist John Bohn to investigate collisions of cold polar NH radicals (produced in this process) with each other and with ultracold atoms such as Rb.		Rb, molecules	NH molecules.

Atoms in optical lattices are analogous to electrons in solid state crystals. Their big advantage is that these "artificial crystals of light" are perfectly clean and highly controllable. Therefore, they are ideal for exploring a whole range of fundamental phenomena that are extremely difficult — or impossible — to study in traditional condensed matter systems. My goal is to study how to control and manipulate these systems to engineer different quantum phases such as superfluids, insulators, quantum magnets, and topological matter. I plan to use them for understanding the physics of strongly correlated bosonic and fermionic systems and nonequilibrium phenomena.

We study the thermodynamics of weakly-interacting Bose and Fermi superfluids (alkali-metal atoms like rubidium, sodium and lithium, but also atomic hydrogen) trapped in magnetic or magneto-optical traps. We analyze single-particle and collective elementary excitations by numerically solving both Bologliubov-de Gennes and Popov equations. Moreover, we investigate dynamical properties of Bose-Einstein condensates by using the time-dependent 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which describes the macroscopic wave-function (order parameter) of the Bose condensate.                Presently we are investigating the dynamics (collective excitations and free expansion) of a two-component Fermi gas in the BCS-BEC crossover and the formation of solitons in atomic mixtures of bosons and fermions. In particular, we are developing a reliable density functional for the unitary Fermi gas (infinite scattering length) at zero and finite teperature.

Sanchez-Palencia Group	http://www.uquantmat.fr/	Ecole Polytechnique and CNRS	France		48.7142971	2.2112917	Theory	The group conducts theoretical research on correlated quantum systems.         In regimes of parameters where matter and fields are governed by the         laws of quantum physics, the interplay of quantum interference and         particle interactions gives rise to fascinating phenomena, such as         Bose-Einstein condensation, Fermi degeneracy, superfluidity,         superconductivity, entanglement, and quantum phase transitions for         instance. In the group, our main efforts focus on the physics of systems         that constitute promising platforms for concrete realization of quantum technologies.         Together with other systems in condensed matter and quantum optics,         ultracold atoms have already produced milestone results, which turn         quantum technologies from dream to reality.                                In the recent years quantum simulation         has established itself at the interface of experiments and theory.         Hence most of the recent dramatic advances on quantum simulations own         much to parallel experimental and theoretical developments. In the         group, we work along three main lines:      Propose new protocols for quantum simulation,,      Elaborate relevant models to interpret and understand simulation results,,      Develop new theoretical approaches for correlated quantum systems.                In this view, we develop both        analytical approaches (field theories, mean field approximation,         bosonization, ...)        and numerical techniques (nonlinear Schrödinger equation, path integral         quantum Monte Carlo, variational Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization,         static and dynamics DMRG, ...).

Schmelcher Group	http://photon.physnet.uni-hamburg.de/ilp/schmelcher/	Center for Optical Quantum Technologies - University of Hamburg	Germany		53.577425	9.887146	Theory	The group explores several complementary aspects of ultracold physics.        The electronic structure and quantum dynamics of ultracold Rydberg atoms and molecules including their dressing in light fields and the coherent excitation dynamics in multi-trap arrays represents one focus. To develop a deep understanding of the mechanisms of quantum and in particular tunneling dynamics is our goal in case of strongly correlated bosons in low-dimensional traps including optical lattices and waveguides. Ultracold scattering in low-dimensions leads to novel interaction properties of atoms with an immediate impact on the corresponding many-body systems. Confinement-induced resonances and molecules formation as well as confinement-induced transparency are examples. We study nonlinear excitations of Bose-Einstein condensates such as solitons and vortices including their stability, structure and dynamics. Formation of ultracold molecules and steering their dynamics via external electric fields such as quantum control of photoassociation processes open the door to a quantum state selective chemical reactions dynamics.		theory

In general most of our research can be described as quantum state engineering. One of the unique features of quantum optical systems is the extremely good experimental control over the systems, down to the level of controlling individual atoms and ions. In our research we develop theories for how one can use this extremely good experimental control to realize interesting physical effects. In particular we have developed theories for how one can realize quantum computers and for interesting effects, which can be realized with ultra cold atoms.		theory	Webpage doesn't work (15.02.2018).

I am presently devising strategies to reduce the effect of the fundamental quantum noise that arises from Heisenberg's uncertainty relationship as applied to atomic spins. In one project, I work on non-destructively measuring and canceling out the quantum fluctuations in the collective spin state of an ensemble of laser-cooled 87Rb atoms in a high-finesse optical cavity. By learning how to minimize the effect of quantum noise in this type of system, I hope to advance the precise measurements required for atomic clocks and in searches for permanent electric dipole moments in atoms and molecules.

The toolkit allows for simulating fermionic superfluids like ultracold atomic gases. Both static and time-depend phenomena can be investigated by means of W-SLDA. The software is optimized towards simulations of large systems, consisting of thousands of particles.W-SLDA Toolkit is designed to solve problems related to fermionic superfluidity. Particularly it is well suited to study static and dynamic properties of ultracold Fermi gases across BCS - BEC crossover. W-SLDA Toolkit implements functionals for reliable studies of systems being in weakly interacting BCS regime (BdG functional) and in the strongly interacting regime, called unitary Fermi gas (SLDA functional).W-SLDA Toolkit allows for studies of the system properties as a function of:interaction strength askF,system dimensionality (1D, 2D, 3D),population imbalance,mass imbalance,temperature.For full list of functionalities see here.
