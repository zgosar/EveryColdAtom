Laser systems currently generate light pulses with field strengths exceeding that of the Coulomb field within an atom or molecule. Pulse durations are as short as a few femtoseconds (10-15 sec) or even less in the attosecond regime, which correspond to the time scales of electron and nuclear dynamics in materials. My group pursues theoretical studies on the coherent control of chemical reactions, the observation of correlated electron dynamics in atoms and molecules, the imaging of molecular dynamics, and the propagation of ultrashort intense laser pulses. We often work in close collaboration with experimental groups.;;;

Such systems are of fundamental importance for ultracold quantum gases, e.g., Bose-Einstein condensates and Degenerate Fermi gases. Collisions involving few atoms can determine the stability/lifetime of ultracold gases and allow for the control of the interactions in the system and the access of novel phases of the matter. Due to its extremely nonpertubative nature, few-body systems pose some of the greatest challenges facing theorists in various fields including atomic, molecular, particle and nuclear physics and chemistry.

In the last decade, the study of such ultracold atom gases has become an interdisciplinary and fascinating field. The realization of degenerate quantum gases opens the way to perform fundamental studies in quantum physics with an almost ideal dilute system displaying tunable properties (density, temperature, interaction strength, ...). This model system can be studied in a highly versatile environment since confining potentials can be tailored at will. Furthermore, since the analysis protocols benefit from the reliability of the laser spectroscopy techniques, the comparison between experimental outcomes and theoretical predictions is much sounder than what is usually met in condensed matter.                To date the available atomic quantum gases are made of atoms interacting through isotropic short-range potentials. The long-range anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction between atoms carrying a large magnetic moment is expected to induce a wealth of new properties. For example, a supersolid phase arises when a dipolar quantum gas is transfered  in a 2D lattice.        The magnetic dipole moment of chromium in the ground state is 6µB. Due to this exceptionally large dipole moment, chromium degenerate gases represent ideal systems to investigate quantum dynamics under the influence of dipolar interactions.        As a first stage to reach degeneracy, we set up a magneto-optical trap for the most abundant bosonic isotope 52Cr and for the fermionic isotope 53Cr. The two isotopes can be trapped separately as well as simultaneously producing a cold dipolar boson-fermion mixture. We studied the collisional properties of these cold gases. In a second stage, several millions 52Cr atoms are optically trapped at the focus of a powerful infrared laser at a temperature on the order of 100µK. Finally, we evaporatively cool the trapped 52Cr atoms down to degeneracy.        We have studied the collective excitations of the chromium BEC and demonstrated the impact of the anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions on the frequencies of the low-energy collective vibration modes of the trapped BEC. In a further set of experiments, we have studied S=3-spin dynamics using our Cr-BECs either in 3D or in restricted 2D and 1D geometries. At very low magnetic fields, spontaneous demagnetization occurs which enables the study of the S=3-spinor physics.        We plan to reach degeneracy for the fermionic isotope 53Cr , and to create strongly correlated systems, by extending our current experiments on the loading of our condensates into optical lattices. This will meet the current burst of interest in the statistical physics of such systems related to the field of quantum magnetism and will open new avenues for the processing of quantum information.

I pursue continuous-wave approaches for application in both gravity-wave antennas and measurement of magnetically induced birefringence of the vacuum. Optical atomic clocks based on a strontium "atomic fountain" will allow "ultra-resolution" determination of linewidths < 10 Hz.

In particular, the recent development of high-energy ultrashort-pulse laser technology (in large part by the research group I co-lead with Professor Murnane) allows generation of coherent extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and soft-X-ray bursts of femtosecond (10-15 sec) and even attosecond duration. (For comparison, the ratio of 1 femtosecond to 1 second is about the same as the ratio of 1 second to 30 million years.) The time scales probed by these light pulses correspond to those of chemical reactions and dynamic processes in semiconductors. Thus short-pulse short-wavelength light provides researchers with a unique tool to observe specific atoms, leading to a deeper understanding of the microscopic mechanisms. In recent years, our group has developed a variety of new techniques to efficiently upconvert ultrashort laser pulses coherently into the EUV and soft-X-ray regions of the spectrum.

The second step uses varying electric fields (Stark deceleration) to slow the cold molecules to rest. Once the molecules are cold and stopped, we can subject them to magnetic trapping, electrostatic trapping, laser cooling, or sympathetic cooling.

My goal is to study how to control and manipulate these systems to engineer different quantum phases such as superfluids, insulators, quantum magnets, and topological matter. I plan to use them for understanding the physics of strongly correlated bosonic and fermionic systems and nonequilibrium phenomena. Additionally, I am interested in studying how to generate and manipulate entanglement in quantum systems for use in quantum information processing and precision measurements.;;;

We study the thermodynamics of weakly-interacting Bose and Fermi superfluids (alkali-metal atoms like rubidium, sodium and lithium, but also atomic hydrogen) trapped in magnetic or magneto-optical traps. We analyze single-particle and collective elementary excitations by numerically solving both Bologliubov-de Gennes and Popov equations. Moreover, we investigate dynamical properties of Bose-Einstein condensates by using the time-dependent 3D Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which describes the macroscopic wave-function (order parameter) of the Bose condensate.                Presently we are investigating the dynamics (collective excitations and free expansion) of a two-component Fermi gas in the BCS-BEC crossover and the formation of solitons in atomic mixtures of bosons and fermions. In particular, we are developing a reliable density functional for the unitary Fermi gas (infinite scattering length) at zero and finite teperature.                We are planning to start the analysis of the condensate properties of p-wave Fermi atoms and d-wave superconductors in the BCS-BEC crossover both in two and three dimensions. Moreover, we are working on the many-body quantum tunneling dynamics of spin-polarized fermions in a double-well potential.;Luca Salasnich, Francesco Ancilotto, Flavio Toigo;;

Sanchez-Palencia Group;http://www.uquantmat.fr/;Ecole Polytechnique and CNRS;France;;0.0;0.0;Theory;The group conducts theoretical research on correlated quantum systems.         In regimes of parameters where matter and fields are governed by the         laws of quantum physics, the interplay of quantum interference and         particle interactions gives rise to fascinating phenomena, such as         Bose-Einstein condensation, Fermi degeneracy, superfluidity,         superconductivity, entanglement, and quantum phase transitions for         instance. In the group, our main efforts focus on the physics of systems         that constitute promising platforms for concrete realization of quantum technologies.         Together with other systems in condensed matter and quantum optics,         ultracold atoms have already produced milestone results, which turn         quantum technologies from dream to reality.                                In the recent years quantum simulation         has established itself at the interface of experiments and theory.         Hence most of the recent dramatic advances on quantum simulations own         much to parallel experimental and theoretical developments. In the         group, we work along three main lines:      Propose new protocols for quantum simulation,,      Elaborate relevant models to interpret and understand simulation results,,      Develop new theoretical approaches for correlated quantum systems.                In this view, we develop both        analytical approaches (field theories, mean field approximation,         bosonization, ...)        and numerical techniques (nonlinear Schrödinger equation, path integral         quantum Monte Carlo, variational Monte Carlo, exact diagonalization,         static and dynamics DMRG, ...).

The electronic structure and quantum dynamics of ultracold Rydberg atoms and molecules including their dressing in light fields and the coherent excitation dynamics in multi-trap arrays represents one focus. To develop a deep understanding of the mechanisms of quantum and in particular tunneling dynamics is our goal in case of strongly correlated bosons in low-dimensional traps including optical lattices and waveguides. Ultracold scattering in low-dimensions leads to novel interaction properties of atoms with an immediate impact on the corresponding many-body systems. Confinement-induced resonances and molecules formation as well as confinement-induced transparency are examples. We study nonlinear excitations of Bose-Einstein condensates such as solitons and vortices including their stability, structure and dynamics. Formation of ultracold molecules and steering their dynamics via external electric fields such as quantum control of photoassociation processes open the door to a quantum state selective chemical reactions dynamics.;;;
