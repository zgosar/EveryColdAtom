	  Data is from <a href="https://ucan.physics.utoronto.ca/research-groups/" target="_blank">UltraCold Atom News (UCAN) webpage</a>. Location was determined by <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro" target="_blank">Google Maps API (geocoding)</a> of the institution name + country. A few locations returned 0 results (mostly the ones with 2 institutions listed), and those were added manually. Which atoms are cold in a particular group was determined manually, from the group's webpage. There are almost 250 groups listed here, so I limited myself to a couple of minutes on each webpage. I helped myself with <a href="https://www.google.si/search?q=Hydrogen+OR+Helium+OR+Lithium+OR+Sodium+OR+Potassium+OR+Rubidium+OR+Caesium+OR+Calcium+OR+Strontium+OR+Chromium+OR+Dysprosium+OR+Erbium+OR+Ytterbium+OR+thorium+OR+barium+site%3Aultracool.ijs.si&oq=Hydrogen+OR+Helium+OR+Lithium+OR+Sodium+OR+Potassium+OR+Rubidium+OR+Caesium+OR+Calcium+OR+Strontium+OR+Chromium+OR+Dysprosium+OR+Erbium+OR+Ytterbium+OR+thorium+OR+barium+site%3Aultracool.ijs.si">this Google Search</a> which gives a lot of false-positives and misses atoms, not on the list. I also didn't bother finding out the differences between different groups with the same webpage - I added See also in the comment. I apologize for any mistakes. If you see any, raise an Issue on GitHub or <a href="mailto:gosar.ziga+everycoldatom@gmail.com">email me</a>. If you don't see your group here I recommend adding it to the UCAN's list. I plan to periodically check it for updates and reflect them here.

	  Otherwise, this website is built with HTML, CSS, and javascript (<a href="http://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> for the map). This is my first real project with any of these, so part of the purpose was to learn new skills. The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/zgosar/EveryColdAtom" target="_blank">here</a> on GitHub, including the Python script which collected the database and generated parts of the webpage.
